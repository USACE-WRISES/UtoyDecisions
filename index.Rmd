# **1. Introduction**   

The Utoy Creek watershed drains the southwest portion of the City of Atlanta into the Chattahoochee River (Figure 1). This small-to-middle order stream is within the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States, and Utoy Creek exhibits many common characteristics of regional streams such as historical channel degradation due to poor sediment management as well  modern challenges like flashy runoff from urban development. The majority of UC’s watershed is situated within the City of Atlanta’s boundaries; however, downstream portion of the watershed are within Fulton County. Two main tributaries, North and South Utoy Creeks, unite to form the main stem approximately five miles upstream the Chattahoochee River (EPA, 2016). The total combined length of the main stem and primary tributaries is approximately 22 miles (Walker, 2016).  Including sub-tributaries, the total length of stream is over 50 miles in the UC watershed. The total drainage basin is approximately 33.7 square miles with 64% developed and 18% impervious.  

![*Figure 1. Overview of the Utoy Creek watershed.*](Utoy_Watershed_Map.png)

In partnership with the City of Atlanta, the USACE's Mobile District is leading a feasibility study of potential stream restoration actions in the Utoy Creek watershed. The study is authorized through the USACE's continuing authorities program for aquatic ecosystem restoration (Section 206, WRDA 1996). In summer 2023, the project development team conducted preliminary project planning activities such as identification of problems and opportunities, setting ecosystem restoration objectives, and screening potential restoration sites. From fall 2023 to summer 2024, the project development team advanced restoration planning through actions such as field data collection, design of alternatives, ecological modeling, cost estimation, and public and interagency meetings. This report summarizes various aspects of these activities for the purpose of informing restoration decisions and recommendations for the study as a whole. Specifically, this document presents cost-effectiveness and incremental cost analyses to guide development of the agency's recommended restoration plan.

Cost-effectiveness and incremental cost analyses (CEICA) are a set of methods for comparing non-monetary ecological benefits with monetary investment costs. Cost-effectiveness analysis provides a mechanism for examining the efficiency of alternative actions (Robinson et al. 1995). An "efficiency frontier" identifies all plans that efficiently provide benefits on a *per cost basis*. Incremental cost analysis is conducted on the set of cost-effective plans. This technique sequentially compares each plan to all higher cost plans to reveal changes in unit cost as output levels increase and eliminates plans that do not efficiently provide benefits on an *incremental unit cost basis*. Collectively, these techniques help USACE planning teams ass the question of "Is the next increment of ecological benefit worth the next increment of investment cost?"

This report applies CEICA in multiple formats to inform decisions in the Utoy Creek watershed. In Chapter 2, the basic strategy of restoration plan formulation is presented along with an overview of ecological benefits and cost estimates. These data provide the fundamental inputs to CEICA and are presented here to contextualized decision making. Additional information on these analyses may be found in other portions of the feasibility report documents. In Chapter 3, CEICA is conducted for individual restoration sites separately to identify recommended outcomes based on ecological criteria (i.e., the authorized purpose). Chapter 4 conducts CEICA at the watershed-scale using the site-scale recommendations from the prior chapter with the goal of identifying an effective portfolio of investments including multiple sites. In Chapter 5, a more comprehenisve view of project benefits is undertaken by applying CEICA to understand the effects of portfolios of actions on social outcomes. Chapter 6 concludes with a synthesis of the recommendations from prior analyses.

# **3. Site-by-site analysis**   

In this section, yada yada yada. Blah, blah, blah.  

Cost-effectiveness analysis provides a mechanism for examining the efficiency of alternative actions (Robinson et al. 1995). For any given level of investment, the agency wants to identify the plan with the most return-on-investment (i.e., the most environmental benefits for a given level of cost or the least cost for a given level of environmental benefit). An "efficiency frontier" identifies all plans that efficiently provide benefits on a *per cost basis*. 


Incremental cost analysis is conducted on the set of cost-effective plans. This technique sequentially compares each plan to all higher cost plans to reveal changes in unit cost as output levels increase and eliminates plans that do not efficiently provide benefits on an *incremental unit cost basis*. Specifically, this analysis examines the slope of the cost-effectiveness frontier to isolate how the unit cost ($/unit) increases as the magnitude of environmental benefit increases. Incremental cost analysis is ultimately intended to inform decision-makers about the consequences of increasing unit cost when increasing benefits (i.e., each unit becomes more expensive). Plans emerging from incremental cost analysis efficiently accomplish the objective relative to unit costs and are typically referred to as "best buys." Importantly, all "best buys" are cost-effective, but all cost-effective plans are not best buys. 


For Utoy Creek, CEICA will ultimately be applied at both the site- and watershed-scales in the feasibility study. However, only watershed scale assessments are presented here for the purpose of site screening. Five separate CEICA analyses are undertaken for: (1) the mainstem Utoy Creek and lower Watershed, (2) North Utoy Creek Watershed, (3) South Utoy Creek Watershed, (4) hydrologic restoration actions, and (5) social outcomes. These sets of actions were separately assessed for multiple reasons. First, a separate prioritization more equitably distributes actions across the watershed and allows the USACE team to see portfolios of actions more clearly emerge. Second, hydrologic and social outcomes relied on different metrics, and separate prioritization facilitates comparison of outcomes in a more comprehensive format. Third, the larger number of sites in Utoy Creek (63 sites) creates numerical limitations to studying portfolios of actions (i.e., 9 * 10^18 potential combinations). Because of this numerical constraint, a maximum five restoration actions were allowed in each portfolio. These four planning sets are presented separately below.  

Conduct CEICA for all sites and store results.
